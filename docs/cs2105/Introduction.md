# Introduction and Resources

Welcome to CS2105! I am Jason Christopher (you can call me Jason) and I am really excited to teach CS2105 Tutorials T13 and T14, AY23/24 Semester 2!

## Tutorial Slides

You can find the latest tutorial slides and most class materials in the following link.

:::tip

I used MS PowerPoint to create the tutorial slides, so best if you can download the slides and view it at the latest version of PowerPoint to preserve the animations and formatting.

## Tutorial Recording

Most tutorials are also recorded, so that you have ample time to review and revise on your own time :D (Jason understands that everyone has different study pacing, so not to worry!)
