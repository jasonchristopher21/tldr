# Introduction and Resources

Welcome to CS2105! I am Jason Christopher (you can call me Jason) and I am really excited to teach CS2105 Tutorials T09 and T10, AY23/24 Semester 1!

## Tutorial Slides

You can find the latest tutorial slides and most class materials in the following link.

Do note that the tutorial slides are provided 

## Tutorial Recording

Most tutorials are also recorded, so that you have ample time to review and revise on your own time :D (Jason understands that everyone has different study pacing, so not to worry!)
